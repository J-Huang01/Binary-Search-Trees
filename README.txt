## Contributions of each partner (if working with a partner)

### Classes we created and edited:

• BinaryTree.java (Ziyue, Jiatan)
• Node.java (Ziyue, Jiatan)


We collaborated on most of the work and discussed the details. Also the teaching assistant gave us some help.

## How to compile and run your program

We tested our completed methods in BinaryTreeTest.java and our code passed all the test cases.
 ## Any assumptions 
We use some recursion to complete the method.
*****

## Additional features that you implemented (if applicable)

there are some helper function used.

• addNode(Node<K, V> newNode, Node<K, V> currentNode)
//this is a helper function to find where to add the node.

• findKey(K key, Node<K,V> current)
//this is a helper function to find the key

• getSize(Node<K,V> root)
//this is a helper method to find the size of the tree

• sameTree(Node<K, V> root, Node<K, V> other)
//this is a helper function to make sure the other tree is same to the subtree

• findNode(K key)
//this is a helper function to use the key to search the node
